# Assignment 1

Starter code for assignment 1

Write your code in file `a1.py`. You can test your code by running `python a1_test`. When you commit your changes to the GitHub repository, it will use `a1_test.py` to run the tests for your feedback.

## Software dependencies

To run the tests, the following modules must be installed:

- numpy
- torch

There is no need to install opencv, matplotlib, or torchvision, unless you use them in your code, of course.
